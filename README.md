# Github-Actions_Demo

This repository will hold terraform code for deploying a small python application on an autscaling group.
As a demo to github actions I will format, validate and deploy(if possible using acloud guru lab) the infrastcture.

The sample app is [Django-Ledger](https://github.com/arrobalytics/django-ledger).
